# Cinnamon Static Web Site Generator

Cinnamon is a simple static web site generator that started as a basic script designed to replace strings in a page with data from various sources. Over time, the script has evolved to meet specific needs and has grown into a snippet of Python code.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Running Cinnamon

```bash
$ ./main.py input_file.txt
Replace input_file.txt with the path to your input file.

Features
Generates HTML based on a template and input file.
Supports configuration through YAML files.
Uses metadata to customize output filenames and include CSS.
Parses input files, extracts keywords, and processes placeholders dynamically.
Refactoring
While the current version of Cinnamon is functional, there are plans to refactor the code for improved maintainability. As the script has grown to suit specific needs, refactoring will ensure cleaner code structure and easier future enhancements.
